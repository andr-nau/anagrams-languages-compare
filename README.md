# anagrams-lang-compare
## This is my training project during attending LinkedIn course "Python: Data Analysis".

The initial challenge was to find all anagrams for given English dictionary. I decided to extend this task for different languages and compare the results. 

__1. Set of words lists (dictionaries) for different languages (EN, RU, UA, DE, FR) has been prepared.__

English main dictionary was provided in LinkedIn course (This is list of words from Webster's Second International Dictionary (1934). 
The copyright has lapsed, and this file is included in Unix and OS X (and found at /usr/share/dict/words) as a reference wordlist for various uses). 

Russian dictionaries are from http://www.speakrus.ru/ (free for non-commercial use).

Ukrainian dictionary are found in project  https://github.com/brown-uk/dict_uk and has Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. 

German, French, and English small dictionaries were found in open access (http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm). 


| language | words | nouns | verbs | adjectives | pronouns | prepositions | conjunctions | personal names | proper names | other |
|:---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|EN		|320k|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
|EN small|194k|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|few|
|UA		|188k|x|x|x||||||many compound words|
|RU		|124k|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|compound words|
|RU small|92k|x|x|x|x|x|x|||compound words|
|DE		|166k|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|
|FR		|207k|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|


__2. All Word lists (dictionaries) has been divided into sets of words of equal length.__

Main features: German peak is shifted towards longer words. Russian small dict has reduced number of long words.

To equalize results for different dictionaries sizes (for different languages), I recalculated results in % of overall number of words in dictionary. 
All languages show similar results in %, so it seems good representation.

To see more detaily all features, let's plot it in log scale:

__3. Main step - finding of anagrams for different languages.__ 

The main idea of the serach for anagrams is to prepare "signatures" of each word - list of all letters of the word in alphabetical order. Then all words with the same signature can make an anagram. An anagram is an equality of two words, so the total number of anagrams (for current signature) is 1/2 of all words that belong to one signature. Anagrams results are also presented using sets of words of equal length. 

Next Figure shows number of anagrams for each "equal length words" set (in absolute values):

Next picture presents the same result, but recalculated in the percents of words number in each word length set:

Additionally, we can plot the result in log scale, to see all features more detaily:

__Preliminary results:__

- All Slavic languages (RU, UA) have similar number of anagrams.
- German group (EN, DE): German shows results similar to Slavic group, whereas English is very similar by anagrams to French (Romance languages).
- Romance group (FR): French is very similar to English. 
- Questions: why smaller English dictionary has larger number of anagrams, even in "%" representation? 

For Russian it's seems OK: in absolute values, small and big dictionaries has almost equal number of anagrams. In % representation small dictionary shows bigger values - 
to get % scale, we divide almost equal number of anagrams for both dicts for each word length, by different number of words of this length.
Bigger dictionary has bigger number of words of each length, and consequently, smaller % of anagrams.
